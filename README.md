# Chandrayan-3_DataAnalysis
The Chandrayan-3 Data Analysis Project conducted using Python in Jupyter Notebook serves as a comprehensive exploration of two crucial components: Component Mass and Power Requirement. Leveraging essential libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn. The dataset is obtained from the official website of the ISRO. The data is meticulously imported from an Excel file, ensuring accuracy and reliability throughout the analysis.
Within the Jupyter Notebook environment, a meticulous data cleaning, transformation, and refinement process is undertaken to guarantee pristine data quality. The dataset is logically segmented into three distinct dataframes, namely propellant, rover, and lander, providing a structured foundation for subsequent analyses.
The heart of the project lies in the Mass Budget and Power Budget analyses, visualized through insightful bar and pie charts. These visual representations offer a clear and concise understanding of the mass distribution and power consumption for each component of Chandrayan-3. The project not only provides valuable insights into the intricate details of Chandrayan-3's components but also establishes a robust methodology for future data analyses within the realm of space exploration.
This GitHub project encapsulates the synergy between cutting-edge Python libraries and data extracted directly from ISRO's authoritative dataset. The clean and well-documented code, coupled with compelling visualizations, makes this project an invaluable resource for both space enthusiasts and data scientists alike.
